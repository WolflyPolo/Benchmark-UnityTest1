# Benchmark-UnityTest1
A short program to test Unity as it spawns a lot of cubes and has a FPS counter. 

For the class of Advanced Computer Architecture, we had to make a Benchmark project, in which I selected to test Unity (2D project) vs Construct 2 (Full 2D). For the Unity Test I made a small script that will spawn as many cubes as it could until a delay appears. 

# Usage
## Web Version
You can visit the following webpage and see the script in action using Unity WebGL [here](https://wolflypolo.itch.io/benchmark-unity2d-test1).

## Local Version
In order to have better results with the short script, it's advised to clone the repository and perform a local profiling. 
```
git clone https://github.com/spolo96/Benchmark-UnityTest1.git
```
