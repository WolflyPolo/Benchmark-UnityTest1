# Benchmark-UnityTest1
A short program to test Unity as it spawns a lot of cubes and has a FPS counter. 

For the class of Advanced Computer Architecture, we had to make a Benchmark project, in which I selected to test Unity (2D project) vs Construct 2 (Full 2D). For the Unity Test I made a small script that will spawn as many cubes as it could until a delay appears.

## Local Version
In order to have better results with the short script, it's advised to clone the repository and perform a local profiling.
